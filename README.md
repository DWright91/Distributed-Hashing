# Distributed-Hashing

Purpose: Write a program in C or C++ that will assign correct values to finger tables of any node.

Requirements:

- m: the number of bits used for identifiers; specifically, 2m is the maximum number of identifiers.

- A list of node identifiers to be used in computing the finger tables is in file nodeIDs

- A command line argument to your program is to be accepted. It will specify the node

for which the finger table is to be displayed.

With m set to 19, provide output on D2L of the finger tables for the following identifiers:

398831 and 523357.

Note that the grading of your program might be done using different identifiers.
